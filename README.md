This repository contains the code for the paper [Trajectory-guided Control Prediction for End-to-end Autonomous Driving: A Simple yet Strong Baseline](). **We will release the code and dataset around Sept.**


TCP is a simple unified framework to combine trajectory and control prediction for end-to-end autonomous driving.  By time of release in June 17 2022, our method achieves new state-of-the-art on [CARLA AD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.carla.org/leaderboard/), in which we rank the **first** in terms of the Driving Score and Infraction Penalty using only a single camera as input.
